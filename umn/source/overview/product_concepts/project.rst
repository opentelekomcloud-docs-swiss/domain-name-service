Project
=======

Projects are used to group and isolate cloud resources, including computing, storage, and network resources. Multiple projects can be created for one account. A project can be a department or a project team.

Private zones are region-level resources. Therefore, private zones are isolated and managed based on projects. You need to create, query, and configure private zones in specific regions and projects.
