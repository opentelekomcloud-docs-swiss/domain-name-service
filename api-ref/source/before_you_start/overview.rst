Overview
========

Welcome to *Domain Name Service API Reference*. Domain Name Service (DNS) is highly available and scalable authoritative domain resolution service that translates domain names like www.example.com into IP addresses like 192.1.2.3 required for network connection. The DNS service allows users to visit your websites or web applications with domain names.

This document describes how to use APIs to perform operations such as creating, deleting, querying, or modifying DNS resources. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <en-us_topic_0132421999>`.

Before you access DNS by calling APIs, get yourself familiar with DNS concepts. For details, see "Service Overview" in the *Domain Name Service User Guide*.
